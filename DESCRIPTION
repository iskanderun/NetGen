Title: Simulate and Sample from Ecological Networks
Description: Generate a wide range of random networks given expected degree, modularity,
             and structure.  Simulations and sampling routines are implemented in FORTRAN,
             providing efficient generation times even for large networks. Basic visualization
             methods also included.
